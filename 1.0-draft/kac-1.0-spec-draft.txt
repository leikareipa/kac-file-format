Introduction to KAC 1.0
=================================

    A KAC 1.0 file is a little-endian binary file containing a static triangle
    mesh defined by vertices, normals, UV coordinates, materials, and texture
    maps.

    The KAC file has no external dependencies - all mesh data (e.g. texture
    maps) are included in the file.

    The KAC format is primarily intended as a companion mesh container for the
    retro-oriented Kelpo renderer (https://www.github.com/leikareipa/kelpo/),
    which targets the Win32 platform and hardware such as the 3dfx Voodoo and
    the 3DLABS Permedia.


Features and limitations of the KAC 1.0 format
=================================

    - A KAC 1.0 file can contain up to 65536 of each of the following:
        - vertices
        - normals
        - UV coordinates
        - materials
        - textures
    - Texture dimensions must be:
        - square
        - power of two
        - between 1 and 256 pixels per side (256 x 256 is the maximum size)
    - All textures are stored with mipmapping of progressive size-halving down to 1 x 1
    - Each vertex must have a material, a normal, and UV coordinates
    - Materials are defined per face but not per vertex
    - Polygon colors are stored in 16 bits with alpha (4444 RGBA)
    - Texture pixels are stored in 16 bits with alpha (5551 RGBA)
    - Animation is not supported


The KAC 1.0 format
=================================

    The data in a KAC 1.0 file are divided into named segments: NORM for
    normals, VERT for vertices, MATE for materials, etc. The segments can
    appear in any order, with the exceptions that the KAC (header) segment
    must appear as the first segment, and the TXTR (textures) segment as
    the last segment.

    The following describes the bit-level format of KAC 1.0.

    Legend:
        XXsb = XX-bit string (not null-terminated)
        XXfb = XX-bit floating-point value
        XXub = XX-bit unsigned integer value
        XXb  = XX bits of data of unspecified type(s)
        ~b   = Variable number of bits
